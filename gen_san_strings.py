        To really understand the code below, we need to understand the algorithm a human uses
        to determine whether a move from a `from_square` to a `to_square` might require a
        file, rank, and/or full-square discriminator.

        First we should consider that if moving from `from_square` to `to_square` is a legal
        move, then even if there is another piece of the same type and color on the ray which extends 
        from `to_square` to `from_square` and continues on to an edge of the board, moving that piece 
        to `to_square` would be illegal. If this piece falls between `from_square` and `to_square`,
        then the original move would not be legal, so we have a contradiction. If it is past 
        `from_square` (on the extension of the ray between the squares that continues to the edge of 
        the board), then it is not legal because it cannot jump over the piece at `from_square` to 
        reach `to_square`.

        This is important when considering disriminators because we are only interested in squares
        from which another `piece` can legally move to `to_square`, and those which might create 
        a situation where a rank, file, or full-square discriminator is necessary.

        With this in mind, the algorithm for determining whether we need a **file** discriminator
        is as follows:
          - Take an empty board and place a `piece` on `to_square`, then get a bitboard `attacks`
            of all the squares it can move to. These may all be considered possible `from_square`s.
          - Consider each `from_square` in `attacks`:
              - Assume the move from `from_square` to `to_square` is legal. Then we know that 
                no other `piece` on the ray from `to_square` to `from_square` is relevant because
                its move to `to_square` would be illegal. Therefore, we can subtract the bitmask 
                of that ray from `attacks` for the next step, creating a bitboard representing all
                the other possible locations of a `piece` that could legally move to `to_square` 
                given that a `piece` can legally move from `from_square` to `to_square`.
              - We also know that any squares in this bitmask which fall on the same file as
                `from_square` are not relevant for determining whether a file discriminator might be 
                required: if another `piece` were to occupy one of those squares, then its move to
                `to_square` would necessarily require a rank discriminator, not a file discriminator.
                Therefore we subtract the bitmask of all squares in `from_square`'s file from the 
                bitboard in the previous step as well.
              - We now have a bitboard of all squares from which a `piece` can legally move to 
                `to_square` (given that the move `piece` from `from_square` to `to_square` is legal)
                such that, if a `piece` really were to occupy any one of those squares, it has 
                potential to create a situation where a file discriminator is necessary. All that
                is left to do is check whether one or more files in this bitboard have any truthy bits.
                If so, then the `from_square` for this iteration can require a file discriminator.
        
        The algorithm for determining whether we need a **rank** discriminator is similar, but
        has some differences which account for the fact that a file discriminator is preferred
        over a rank discriminator when both can disambiguate the move:
          - Take an empty board and place a `piece` on `to_square`, then get a bitboard `attacks`
            of all the squares it can move to. These may all be considered possible `from_square`s.
          - Consider each `from_square` in `attacks`:
              - Subtract the extended ray from `to_square` towards `from_square` from `attacks`
                by the same logic as above.
              - This time, we know that any squares that **do not** fall on the same file as 
                `from_square` are not relevant for determining whether a rank discriminator might be 
                required: if another `piece` were to occupy one of those squares, then its move to
                `to_square` would necessarily require a file discriminator, not a rank discriminator.
                Therefore we use a logical AND between the bitboard from the previous step and the
                bitmask of all squares in `from_square`'s file.
              - By the same logic as above, all that is left to do is check whether one or more ranks
                in this bitboard have any truthy bits. If so, then the `from_square` for this 
                iteration can require a rank discriminator.
        
        Determining whether we need a **full-square** discriminator is actually the simplest:
          - Take an empty board and place a `piece` on `to_square`, then get a bitboard `attacks`
            of all the squares it can move to. These may all be considered possible `from_square`s.
          - Consider each `from_square` in `attacks`:
              - Subtract the extended ray from `to_square` towards `from_square` from `attacks`
                by the same logic as above.
              - A full-square discriminator is required when there is another `piece` on `from_square`'s
                same file and another one on its same rank that can both move to `to_square`. Therefore,
                can use a logical AND between `attacks` and the bitmask of all squares in `from_square`'s
                file, then do the same for its rank, and if both of these have truthy bits, then the
                `from_square` for this iteration can require a full-square discriminator.
        
        The logic for all three of these cases can be combined into a single loop, which is what
        happens in the code below.
